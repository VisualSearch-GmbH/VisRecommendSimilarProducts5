## Description
**Automatically generates visually similar product recommendations**

We offer testing with support for 10 days for free!

This plugin provides automatic creation of visually similar recommendations for all available products. The creation of these recommendations is possible using an innovative algorithm that automatically finds visually related products in all available categories. These visually related products will be displayed in the product detail page as a cross-selling tab.

In this plugin, the provided recommendations are created with a custom AI algorithm. This algorithm is running on an external server and a valid API key is needed to access this service.

Below is an example of visually similar recommendations of a red jacket. Other examples can be found in our demo store here: https://shopware5.visualsearch.at
